The program I created, was a input question the user what favorite movie genre is, then showing them 3 movie, then when they pick a movie it will give them a summary of said movie. My program requires the user to put in an input to ask the question, if, and elif to seperate the movie genres, and else function to make sure that if they ask for other movies not listed.

This program what created by RJ Boyd grade 11th grader.
