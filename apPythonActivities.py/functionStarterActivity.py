 "Function is a container for code that have 1 or more objectives"

# 2. What is are function parameters and arguments and describe
# the difference between the 2.
∞ #A parameter is a variable in a function definition. It is a placeholder and hence does not
∞  #have a concrete value. An argument is a value passed during function invocation. 

# 3. write a function that will print out a welcome message
# that includes a users name. You will need to use parameters and arguments

# 5. Write a function that will output a message to a user, telling them
# what class they have next after this one. this code should use a 
# variable to pass a value into the parameter of a function. The variable should
# be real, user data- not hard coded data.
