# One of the major project is th scan landscapes with of there drones to make a digital version of said
# landscape with a website or newly introduced VR headset. This allows the user to see and plan out how to 
# work or start construction on a piece of land.

# The XR software could be use to predict how much work needs to be done on a piece of land. Gaming engine
# was created for game development or other complicated programs.

# They take massive amounts of data and shrink it down to mangeable levels for a computer program to use.
# They have a 3d digital image of the world and this site can nearly go anywhere in the world. The data
# will decide where in the world you can go.

# This data map can only be made through real world means, anything fictional can not be made. The companies
# primary goal was to create 3d geospatial visualization with that being finish, there new goal is to upgrade
# and improve upon the 3d program to make sure people use it.
